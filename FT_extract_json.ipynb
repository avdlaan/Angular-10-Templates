One possible way to prevent mental health problems is to build-up coping resources that promote resilience to the effects of disaster work. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a resilience building workshop, the Disaster Worker Resiliency Training Program (DWRT), in disaster workers previously exposed to Hurricane Sandy. Methods Disaster workers (N = 167) were randomly assigned to the DWRT workshop (n = 78) or a waitlist (n = 89). Workers completed self-report measures on healthy lifestyle behaviors, perceived stress, depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline and 3-month follow-up. They also completed a measure assessing subsequent trauma-exposure between the baseline and 3-month post-intervention. Results Participants in the workshop condition, as compared to those in a waitlist control, reported significantly greater improvements from pre-intervention (T1) to 3-month follow-up (T2) in healthy lifestyle behaviors (η 2 = .03; p = .03), stress management (η 2 = .03, p = .04), and spiritual growth (η 2 = .03, p = .02). Among participants reporting subsequent trauma exposures between T1 and T2 (n = 101), participants in the waitlist condition, were more likely to report significant increases in perceived stress (η 2 = .07, p < .01), PTSD (η 2 = .05, p = .03), and depression (η 2 = .07, p < .01) symptoms. Conclusions Participation in the resilience workshop promoted engagement in positive health behaviors and reduced the incidence of mental health symptoms, especially when administered prior to a repeat trauma exposure. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term health effects of participation in the program.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}\n",

            "{'text': 'Since the COVID-19 pandemic onset, the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 has been 27 extensively characterized. Antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein 28 are frequently encoded by IGHV3-53/3-66 with a short CDR H3. Germline-encoded sequence 29 motifs in CDRs H1 and H2 play a major role, but whether any common motifs are present in CDR 30 H3, which is often critical for binding specificity, have not been elucidated. Here, we identify two 31 public clonotypes of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a 9-residue CDR H3 that pair with 32 different light chains. Distinct sequence motifs on CDR H3 are present in the two public clonotypes 33 that appear to be related to differential light chain pairing. Additionally, we show that Y58F is a 34 common somatic hypermutation that results in increased binding affinity of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD 35 antibodies with a short CDR H3. Overall, our results advance fundamental understanding of the 36 antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of 39 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 1,2 , which primarily results in respiratory distress, cardiac 40 failure, and renal injury in the most severe cases 3,4 . The virion is decorated with the spike (S) 41 glycoprotein, which contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that mediates virus entry by 42 binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor on the surface of host cells 1,5-7 . To 43 mitigate the devastating social and economic consequences of the pandemic, vaccines and post-44 exposure prophylaxes including antibody cocktails that exploit reactivity to the S protein are being 45 developed at an unprecedented rate. Several vaccines are currently in various stages of clinical 46 trials 8,9 . Most notable are the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which have 47 been issued emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration for distribution in 48 the United States 10-12 and the Oxford-AstraZeneca chimpanzee adenovirus vectored DNA vaccine 49 in the United Kingdom 13-15 . In humans, most neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 target the 50 immunodominant RBD on the S protein 16,17 , and can abrogate virus attachment and entry into 51 host cells 18,19 . In the past year, many RBD antibodies have been isolated and characterized from 52 convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients 20-40 . 53 54 Antibody diversity is generated through V(D)J recombination 41-43 . Three genes, one from each of 55 the variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) loci, are combined to form the coding region for the 56 heavy chain.

Traditional cancer cell lines or immortalized cell lines are genetically and phenotypically different from host cells. Animal models are widely used, but often fail to reflect a physiological and pathogenic status because of species tropisms. There is an unmet need for normal human epithelial cells for disease modeling. In this study, we successfully established long term cultures of normal human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (KPTECs) in 2D and 3D culture systems using conditional reprogramming (CR) and organoids techniques. These cells had the ability to differentiate and repair DNA damage, and showed no transforming property. Importantly, the CR KPTECs maintained lineage function with expression of specific transporters (SLC34A3 and cubilin). They also expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, cancer cell line did not express endogenous SLC34A3, cubilin and ACE2. Very interestingly, ACE2 expression was around twofold higher in 3D organoids culture compared to that in 2D CR culture condition. Pseudovirion assays demonstrated that SARS-CoV spike (S) protein was able to enter CR cells with luciferase reporter.

Unravelling the dynamic structural features used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal novel therapeutic targets.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}\n",

This conformational changes lead to an alternating pattern in conserved disulfide bond configurations positioned at the hinge, indicating a possible disulfide exchange, an important allosteric switch implicated in viral entry of various viruses, including HIV and murine coronavirus.

However, the elicitation of b12 or b12-like antibodies in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. B12 is highly divergent from the closest corresponding germline antibody while X5 is less divergent. We have hypothesized that the relatively high degree of specific somatic hypermutations may preclude binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) to closest germline antibodies, and that identifying antibodies that are intermediates in the pathways to maturation could help design novel vaccine immunogens to guide the immune system for their enhanced elicitation. In support of this hypothesis we have previously found that a germline-like b12 (monovalent and bivalent scFv as an Fc fusion protein or IgG) lacks measurable binding to an Env as measured by ELISA with a sensitivity in the µM range [1]; here we present evidence confirming and expanding these findings for a panel of Envs. In contrast, a germline-like scFv X5 bound Env with high (nM) affinity. To begin to explore the maturation pathways of these antibodies we identified several possible b12 intermediate antibodies and tested their neutralizing activity. These intermediate antibodies neutralized only some HIV-1 isolates and with relatively weak potency. In contrast, germline-like scFv X5 neutralized a subset of the tested HIV-1 isolates with comparable efficiencies to that of the mature X5.

Results Intubation and extubation generated small particles (< 5 µm) in mean concentrations 12 times greater than background noise (p < 0.001). The mean particle concentrations during endonasal access were 4.5 times greater than background (p = 0.01). Particles were typically large (> 75 µm), remained airborne for up to 10 s and travelled up to 1.1 m. Use of a microdebrider generated mean aerosol concentrations 18 times above baseline (p = 0.005).

On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic. By mid-March COVID-19 cases were spreading across the US with several hotspots appearing by April. Health officials point to the importance of surveillance of COVID-19 to better inform decision makers at various levels and efficiently manage distribution of human and technical resources to areas of need. The prospective space-time scan statistic has been used to help identify emerging COVID-19 disease clusters, but results from this approach can encounter strategic limitations imposed by constraints of the scanning window. This paper presents a different approach to COVID-19 surveillance based on a spatiotemporal event sequence (STES) similarity. In this STES based approach, adapted for this pandemic context we compute the similarity of evolving daily COVID-19 incidence rates by county and then cluster these sequences to identify counties with similarly trending COVID-19 case loads. We analyze four study periods and compare the sequence similarity-based clusters to prospective space-time scan statistic-based clusters. The sequence similarity-based clusters provide an alternate surveillance perspective by identifying locations that may not be spatially proximate but share a similar disease progression pattern. Results of the two approaches taken together can aid in tracking the progression of the pandemic to aid local or regional public health responses and policy actions taken to control or moderate the disease spread.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}\n",

Few qualitative studies have described the experience of perinatal depression among WLWH to identify the underlying social-structural determinants of poor mental health and potential strategies to intervene. We conducted a longitudinal qualitative study applying semi-structured interviews with 30 WLWH at three timepoints (28-38 weeks pregnant, 6-weeks postpartum and 5-7 months postpartum) to understand mental health experiences of perinatal WLWH in western Kenya. Financial insecurity emerged as the central theme impacting the mental health of women across time. Financial insecurity was often attributed to the loss of employment, related to pregnancy and the demands of breastfeeding and caring for an infant, as well as a lack of support from male partners. The loss of income and subsequent financial strain contributed to worsening levels of food insecurity and relationship stress and challenged engagement in HIV care. In this way, increased financial strain during the perinatal period negatively impacted the mental health of perinatal WLWH. Our findings suggest support to meet basic needs and remain engaged in HIV care during pregnancy and postpartum could improve perinatal mental health for WLWH in this setting.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}\n",

This real-world exploratory study was conducted to determine patient-perspectives regarding their treatment satisfaction receiving Divya-Swasari-Coronil-Kit with correlative impacts on psychological health (PH) and Quality of life (QoL) based on four hypotheses each relating to PH, QoL, Demographic characteristics, and Treatment satisfaction. Methods: This cross-sectional, web-based survey collected data on demographic characteristics and psychological health with DASS-21; QoL with 5-level 5-dimension EuroQol instrument; and treatment satisfaction using Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) V9. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to examine the relation between TSQM and PH and the demographic variables. Factor analysis was used for multi-collinearity tests, and multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore demographic variables and TSQM. Results: Out of 421 initial screenings, 367 patient-participants were included in the analysis. The mean age of included participants was 33.61 ± 9.47 years. Marital status and socio-economic class positively correlated with TSQM. Physical symptoms in patients are positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and stress; and in contrast, negatively with QoL. Global satisfaction with Divya-Swasari-Coronil-Kit medication negatively correlated with depression, anxiety, stress, effectiveness, convenience; whereas global satisfaction correlated positively with QoL. Conclusion: Present study (SATISFACTION COVID) indicates that treatment satisfaction due to avaliablity and treatment of Divya-Swasari-Coronil-Kit has constructive and beneficial implications on psychological health, Quality of life and demographic factors. In addition, web-based patient-reported perspectives may well be a feasible way to provide better insights into treatment satisfaction, in relation to psychological health and Quality of life.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}\n",

Methods Disaster workers (N = 167) were randomly assigned to the DWRT workshop (n = 78) or a waitlist (n = 89). Workers completed self-report measures on healthy lifestyle behaviors, perceived stress, depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline and 3-month follow-up. They also completed a measure assessing subsequent trauma-exposure between the baseline and 3-month post-intervention. Results Participants in the workshop condition, as compared to those in a waitlist control, reported significantly greater improvements from pre-intervention (T1) to 3-month follow-up (T2) in healthy lifestyle behaviors (η 2 = .03; p = .03), stress management (η 2 = .03, p = .04), and spiritual growth (η 2 = .03, p = .02).

              "1  {'text': 'Objectives Disaster workers are at elevated risk for mental health problems as a result of trauma exposures during response efforts. One possible way to prevent mental health problems is to build-up coping resources that promote resilience to the effects of disaster work. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a resilience building workshop, the Disaster Worker Resiliency Training Program (DWRT), in disaster workers previously exposed to Hurricane Sandy. Methods Disaster workers (N = 167) were randomly assigned to the DWRT workshop (n = 78) or a waitlist (n = 89). Workers completed self-report measures on healthy lifestyle behaviors, perceived stress, depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline and 3-month follow-up. They also completed a measure assessing subsequent trauma-exposure between the baseline and 3-month post-intervention. Results Participants in the workshop condition, as compared to those in a waitlist control, reported significantly greater improvements from pre-intervention (T1) to 3-month follow-up (T2) in healthy lifestyle behaviors (η 2 = .03; p = .03), stress management (η 2 = .03, p = .04), and spiritual growth (η 2 = .03, p = .02). Among participants reporting subsequent trauma exposures between T1 and T2 (n = 101), participants in the waitlist condition, were more likely to report significant increases in perceived stress (η 2 = .07, p < .01), PTSD (η 2 = .05, p = .03), and depression (η 2 = .07, p < .01) symptoms. Conclusions Participation in the resilience workshop promoted engagement in positive health behaviors and reduced the incidence of mental health symptoms, especially when administered prior to a repeat trauma exposure. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term health effects of participation in the program.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}\n",

In a broader context, however, this case demonstrates the importance of community, spirituality and a social support network while fighting a life-threatening illness, especially one that demands social and physical isolation while convalescing. Many are attracted to practice in the field of sports medicine due to a sense of community and teamwork that parallels the goals of the individual athlete. This case illustrates the unconventional role sports medicine physicians, orthopedic surgeons and team sports chiropractors have undertaken in the battle versus Covid-19, specifically consulting on the patient while creating an outreach program in the hopes of contributing to the patient's sense of wellness. In this unique case, our patient is a current soccer coach and former professional soccer player known well in the American and El Salvadorian soccer communities. The community he has devoted his life's work to played a pivotal role in his battle against COVID-19. While this disease has undoubtedly resulted in global upheaval, community support, particularly that of the Washington D.C. Soccer community and the D.C.

Most LMICs had not produced reports in Q1 or Q2 journals in this period, constituting a large gap in knowledge. However, from the reported evidence it is clear that the rate of ICU-acquired infections was comparable, albeit approximately 10% higher, in LMICs compared to high income countries. In contrast, ICU mortality was much higher in LMICs (33.6%) than in high income countries (< 20%). Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative species, especially Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae played a much more dominant role in LMIC ICUs than in those in high income countries.

One possible way to prevent mental health problems is to build-up coping resources that promote resilience to the effects of disaster work. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a resilience building workshop, the Disaster Worker Resiliency Training Program (DWRT), in disaster workers previously exposed to Hurricane Sandy. Methods Disaster workers (N = 167) were randomly assigned to the DWRT workshop (n = 78) or a waitlist (n = 89). Workers completed self-report measures on healthy lifestyle behaviors, perceived stress, depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline and 3-month follow-up. They also completed a measure assessing subsequent trauma-exposure between the baseline and 3-month post-intervention. Results Participants in the workshop condition, as compared to those in a waitlist control, reported significantly greater improvements from pre-intervention (T1) to 3-month follow-up (T2) in healthy lifestyle behaviors (η 2 = .03; p = .03), stress management (η 2 = .03, p = .04), and spiritual growth (η 2 = .03, p = .02). Among participants reporting subsequent trauma exposures between T1 and T2 (n = 101), participants in the waitlist condition, were more likely to report significant increases in perceived stress (η 2 = .07, p &lt; .01), PTSD (η 2 = .05, p = .03), and depression (η 2 = .07, p &lt; .01) symptoms. Conclusions Participation in the resilience workshop promoted engagement in positive health behaviors and reduced the incidence of mental health symptoms, especially when administered prior to a repeat trauma exposure. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term health effects of participation in the program.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}</td>\n",

In a broader context, however, this case demonstrates the importance of community, spirituality and a social support network while fighting a life-threatening illness, especially one that demands social and physical isolation while convalescing. Many are attracted to practice in the field of sports medicine due to a sense of community and teamwork that parallels the goals of the individual athlete.

One possible way to prevent mental health problems is to build-up coping resources that promote resilience to the effects of disaster work. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a resilience building workshop, the Disaster Worker Resiliency Training Program (DWRT), in disaster workers previously exposed to Hurricane Sandy. Methods Disaster workers (N = 167) were randomly assigned to the DWRT workshop (n = 78) or a waitlist (n = 89). Workers completed self-report measures on healthy lifestyle behaviors, perceived stress, depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline and 3-month follow-up. They also completed a measure assessing subsequent trauma-exposure between the baseline and 3-month post-intervention. Results Participants in the workshop condition, as compared to those in a waitlist control, reported significantly greater improvements from pre-intervention (T1) to 3-month follow-up (T2) in healthy lifestyle behaviors (η 2 = .03; p = .03), stress management (η 2 = .03, p = .04), and spiritual growth (η 2 = .03, p = .02). Among participants reporting subsequent trauma exposures between T1 and T2 (n = 101), participants in the waitlist condition, were more likely to report significant increases in perceived stress (η 2 = .07, p < .01), PTSD (η 2 = .05, p = .03), and depression (η 2 = .07, p < .01) symptoms.

Most LMICs had not produced reports in Q1 or Q2 journals in this period, constituting a large gap in knowledge. However, from the reported evidence it is clear that the rate of ICU-acquired infections was comparable, albeit approximately 10% higher, in LMICs compared to high income countries. In contrast, ICU mortality was much higher in LMICs (33.6%) than in high income countries (< 20%). Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative species, especially Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae played a much more dominant role in LMIC ICUs than in those in high income countries.
